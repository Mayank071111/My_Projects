Pimpri Chichwad too bettered its ranking, securing 19th spot ..
PUNE: In a huge improvement over its 15th rank last year, Pune secured fifth position among the cities with more than 10 lakh population in the Union government’s cleanliness survey this year. As a municipal corporation, with 1 lakh-plus population, Pune ranked eighth.
The modern city of Pune has many distinct neighbourhoods. These include the numerous peths of the old city on the eastern bank of the Mutha river, the cantonment areas of Khadki and Camp established by the British, and numerous suburbs.[65] The industrial growth in the Pimpri, Chinchwad, Akurdi, Nigdi and nearby areas allowed these areas to incorporate a new governing municipal corporation.[66][83][84][85][86][87][88]

The Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), initially defined in 1967, has grown to 7,256 km2 made up of the ten talukas of the Pune district.[89] The areas of PMC and PCMC along with the three cantonment areas of Camp, Khadki, and Dehu Road form the urban core of the PMR, which also includes seven municipal councils and 842 villages.[89][90][91]
